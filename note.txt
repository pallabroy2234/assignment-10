Next js Folder  structure :


src => SRC directory in next js is the location where all of your application's source code is stored. This directory is where you will create your components, pages, style, and any other files that make up your next js project.

app => App directory is used for handling routes and rendering views in Next.js, and it is built to make the most out of React concurrent features. The app directory works alongside the pages directory to allow for incremental adoption. It supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.

globals.css => Define your global css in this file.

layout.js => It's an entry-level file in your next application. This file is executed first when you run the application.

page.js => This js file defines your route. By default, it's your home page or route.

page.module.css => This css file defines your page.js css. When you see a file name module.css then you think that it's a particular css file for a particular component file.
